# Ahead.js

Yet another React.js framework

---

## Note

### This project is in early development and is not ready for production use yet. Please be patient!

Ahead.js is a framework inspired by Next.js by Vercel. It's a framework which uses [React.js](https://react.dev), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) to create a server side rendered application.

## Interested into learning React?

Consider checking React's [learn page](https://react.dev/learn) to learn more about React as well as get familiar with basic concepts of the framework.

## Motivation

Personally, I loved the concept of Next.js. I really like how they've put such a complicated concept into a simple framework. However, I was missing something that I was familiar with since I started web development: Express. That's what was my motivation to create Ahead.js. I wanted to create a framework that would be easy to use and would be familiar to people who are used to Express. And that brings us to the next section:

## Why Ahead.js?

Ahead.js brings the best of both worlds. It uses React.js for rendering, React Router for routing on client and for SSR and Express.js as the router.
